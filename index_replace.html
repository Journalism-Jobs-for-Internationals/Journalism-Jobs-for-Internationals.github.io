            <p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
                International journalists struggle with a lack of connections and information when it comes to getting a newsroom job in the US.
                That’s why we started Journalism Jobs for Internationals. Our target audience is global journalists who want to work here and newsrooms seeking to become more diverse and inclusive.

            <p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                Our first step is to build an informational platform of newsrooms that hire journalists with visas or will sponsor them. At this point, our list is small. We hope – with your help – to expand it. So if you know of a newsroom or newsrooms that will hire journalists with visas, please enter that information here.
